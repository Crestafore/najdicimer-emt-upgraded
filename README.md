## Development
Two main technologies are used for development. The Spring MVC framework used for building our RESTful API and the magic of Angular 1.4 used for the user interaction. Other technologies include JPA, MySQL, twitter-bootstrap, working with JSON data and few others.

## Who are we?
We are three colleagues -- web enthusiasts and are always open to talk about anything web-related.
